#Zombies!
This is a small game project done originally for Hive 48h Game Jam event. This is my first dive into game developement.

I started by following this great tutorial https://simplegametutorials.github.io/love/asteroids/

From there I figured out a different goal for the game and started to make it my own. v0.1 is the version done during the Game Jam.

I continue to work with the game from time to time.
TODO: Sounds, more graphics, levels, storymode, etc...

SYNOPSIS: There is a zombie virus spreading and you have the cure! Can you cure everyone before there are no more healthy people left?
